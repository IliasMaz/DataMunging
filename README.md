# Data Munging through Python

## Description

This repository contains Python code, primarily using the pandas library, for the initial stages of working with a loan dataset. 
The project focuses on **Data Exploration**, **Data Cleaning**, and **Data Preparation**. Key steps include understanding the data structure, handling missing values, converting data columns to appropriate types (like numeric and datetime), cleaning string data, and encoding categorical variables into a numerical format using dummy variables. This work prepares the dataset for subsequent analysis or potential future modeling.

Key Focus: Coarse and Fine Classification 

## Setup

Ensure you have Python 3 installed. The core libraries required are:

- `pandas`: Essential for all data manipulation and analysis tasks.
- `numpy`: Often used in conjunction with pandas for numerical operations (e.g., handling NaNs).
